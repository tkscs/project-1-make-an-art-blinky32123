# Project Proposal

1. Roughly, what will your drawing look like
My drawing will be a square  with a triangle on each side and on the farthest point of the triangle from the square, i connect all those points so it creates a bigger square. then doing it one more time 

2. What are two variables you could use so that when you change each variable, the drawing changes?

two variable i could use to change the drawing is a variable for the 

length of the internal square, and a variable for the angle of the triangle connected to the square

3. Where is there repetition in your drawing?

both the inside and outside square  will have  repetition to create them and then repeating this step.

4. What are the main parts of your drawing? Are there clear sections or objects?

there is 1 square with a triangle on each side of it(4), then a square over that, another triangle on each side(4) and then one more square.

5. How could you use a loop variable of a for loop? Is there somewhere in your drawing where something is repeated, but it's slightly different each time? Maybe the same object is repeated in different places, or maybe a similar object is repeated but with different sizes?

I could use a loop variable to change the size of the second repetition of the shape as its the same shape with different size sides.

6. Sketch your image, take a picutre, and add it here!
